Submission Instructions for Problem Set 1

Although Jupyter Notebooks are a very useful tool for interactively playing with SQL queries, it turns out that they make autograding a pain. As a workaround, we’ve included an autograder-friendly submission template file (submit.py) for submitting your work.

The template contains a lot of skeleton XML code, but you don’t need to worry about how it works. Please fill out the fields marked with comments in the template. For each question, copy and paste your final answer into the appropriate location in the template.

Importantly, for SQL queries please omit the leading %sql and %%sql IPython commands!

Please let us know on Piazza if you're stuck or confused about where to copy your answers.

Once you’ve copied all of your code into the submission template, you’re ready to upload your code to myth/corn!

First, log into either the myth or the corn cluster.

ssh [SUNet ID]@corn.stanford.edu

Once logged in, create a new directory for your submission. This directory should ONLY contain the files you intend to submit. (The submit script will copy ALL of the files present in this directory.)

Example (the actual directory name doesn’t matter):

mkdir ~/cs145_ps1

Copy your submit.py from your local machine into the new directory.

On Linux and OS X you can copy files to myth/corn using SCP. To do so, run the following command on your local machine:

scp -r [local path to directory containing files] [SUNet ID]@corn.stanford.edu:~/[directory for this assignment]

On Windows, you can use an SFTP client like WinSCP to copy the files to myth/corn:

http://winscp.net/eng/download.php

Feel free to use any alternative methods of copying your files to myth/corn that you may prefer.

Before submitting, PLEASE SANITY CHECK YOUR SUBMISSION TEMPLATE. To run the sanity checker, run the following command in the directory containing your submit.py file:
(you will have to run "pip install --user prettytable" again)

python /usr/class/cs145/bin/sanity_check.py

It will notify you of any problems that would break the autograder and verifies that your output matches the correct output.

If your template passes the sanity checker, you can submit your assignment by running the following command in your submission directory:

/usr/class/cs145/bin/submit-pset

Please note that this script will copy ALL of the files present in the current directory, so please only include files that you intend to submit. Once again, please make sure the current directory contains your submit.py file (but not your Jupyter notebook).

If you have any questions or encounter any issues with the submission process, please let us know!
